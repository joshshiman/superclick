Last Updated: March 08, 2025  

Superclick does not collect, store, or share any user data. This extensionâ€™s sole purpose is to allow users to search highlighted text in a new tab using Command+Shift+Click. No personal information, browsing history, or text content is accessed, transmitted, or recorded.  

We use the 'tabs' permission to create new search tabs and the '<all_urls>' host permission to run on any webpage, but these are solely for functionality and do not involve data collection.
